# Students_db_1
An exercise to use both Bash scripting and PostgreSQL to make a database about students. 

Refer to the file **students.sql** to see the final product. 

The database **students** with tables students, majors, courses and majors_courses are created using PostgreSQL.
The file **insert_data.sh** then reads the csv files **students.csv** and **courses.csv** and inserts all the data into the database, all without manually inserting one by one.
